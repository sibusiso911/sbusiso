# Celo Development 101 - Introduction

## Introduction
In this community, you will learn about Celo and build a marketplace DApp on top of the Celo blockchain.

### Learning Objective
After finishing the learning materials in this course, you will:

1. Understand the advantages of the Celo open-source platform.
2. Be able to write smart contracts in the popular Solidity language and deploy them to the Celo blockchain.
3. Know how to build an HTML/Javascript web DApp that interacts with the Celo blockchain.

### Disclaimer
The DApp built in this course is for educational purposes only. In order to create a simple comprehensive DApp, we had to limit usability and security.  Please donâ€™t use this DApp to transfer real money in a production environment.

### Prerequisites
In order to complete this course you should:

1. Have access to a desktop computer with internet and a chrome web browser.
2. Have basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript.
